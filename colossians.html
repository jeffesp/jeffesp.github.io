      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

      <p><sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of <span class="hi">Christ Jesus</span> by the will of God, and Timothy our
	brother,</p>

      <p><sup>2</sup> To the saints and faithful brothers in <span class="hi">Christ</span> at Colossae: Grace to you
	and peace from God our Father.</p>

      <p><sup>3</sup> We always thank God, the Father of our <span class="hi">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, when we pray for
	you, </p>

      <p><sup>4</sup> since we heard of your faith in <span class="hi">Christ Jesus</span> and of the love that
	you have for all the saints,</p>

   <p> <sup>5</sup> because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have
     heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel, </p>

   <p> <sup>6</sup> which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is
     bearing fruit and increasing-as it also does among you, since the
     day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth,</p>

   <p> <sup>7</sup> just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow
     servant. He is a faithful minister of <span class="hi">Christ</span> on your behalf</p>

<p> <sup>8</sup> and has made known to us your love in the Spirit.</p>
   
  <p> <sup>9</sup> And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for
     you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will
     in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</p>

      
  <p> <sup>10</sup> so as to walk in a manner worthy of the <span class="hi">Lord</span>, fully pleasing
     to <span class="hi">him</span>: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the
     knowledge of God;</p>

 <p>  <sup>11</sup> being strengthened with all power, according to <span class="hi">his</span> glorious
     might, for all endurance and patience with joy;</p>

   <p> <sup>12</sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in
     the inheritance of the saints in light. </p>

   <p><sup>13</sup> He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and
     transferred us to the kingdom of <span class="hi">his beloved Son</span>,</p>
   
  <p> <sup>14</sup>in <span class="hi">whom</span> we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</p>
   
  <p> <sup>15</sup> <span class="hi">He</span> is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
     creation.</p>

   <p><sup>16</sup> For by <span class="hi">him</span> all things were created, in heaven and on earth,
     visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
     authorities-all things were created through <span class="hi">him</span> and for <span class="hi">him</span>.</p>

   <p><sup>17</sup> And <span class="hi">he</span> is before all things, and in <span class="hi">him</span> all things hold
     together.</p>

   <p><sup>18</sup> And <span class="hi">he</span> is the head of the body, the church. <span class="hi">He</span> is the
     beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything <span class="hi">he</span>
     might be preeminent.</p>

   <p><sup>19</sup> For in <span class="hi">him</span> all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, </p>

  <p><sup>20</sup> and through <span class="hi">him</span> to reconcile to <span class="hi">himself</span> all things, whether on
     earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of <span class="hi">his</span> cross.</p>
   
   <p> <sup>21</sup> And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing
     evil deeds,</p>

   <p> <sup>22</sup> <span class="hi">he</span> has now reconciled in <span class="hi">his</span> body of flesh by his death, in
     order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before
     <span class="hi">him</span>,</p>

			   
   <p> <sup>23</sup> if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not
     shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has
     been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,
     Paul, became a minister.</p>
   
   <p> <sup>24</sup> Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh
     I am filling up what is lacking in <span class="hi">Christ's</span> afflictions for the
     sake of his body, that is, the church,</p>

  <p> <sup>25</sup> of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from
     God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully
     known,</p>

   <p> <sup>26</sup> the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed
     to his saints. </p>

   <p> <sup>27</sup> To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles
     are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is <span class="hi">Christ</span> in
     you, the hope of glory. </p>

  <p><sup>28</sup> <span class="hi">Him</span> we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with
     all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in <span class="hi">Christ</span>.</p>

   <p><sup>29</sup> For this I toil, struggling with all <span class="hi">his</span> energy that he
     powerfully works within me.</p>

      
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

      <p><sup>1</sup> For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for
      those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face,</p>
   
      <p><sup>2</sup> that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to
      reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's
      mystery, which is <span class="hi">Christ</span>, </p>

      <p><sup>3</sup> in <span class="hi">whom</span> are hidden all the treasures of
      wisdom and knowledge. </p>

      <p><sup>4</sup> I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible
      arguments.</p>

      <p><sup>5</sup> For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit,
      rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in <span
                                                                                 class="hi">Christ</span>.</p>

      <p><sup>6</sup> Therefore, as you received <span class="hi">Christ Jesus the
              Lord</span>, so walk in <span class="hi">him</span>,</p>

      <p><sup>7</sup> rooted and built up in <span class="hi">him</span> and established
      in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p>

      <p><sup>8</sup> See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty
      deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the
      world, and not according to <span class="hi">Christ</span>. </p>

      <p><sup>9</sup> For in <span class="hi">him</span> the whole fullness of deity
      dwells bodily, </p>

      <p><sup>10</sup> and you have been filled in <span class="hi">him</span>, who is the
      head of all rule and authority. </p>

      <p><sup>11</sup> In <span class="hi">him</span> also you were circumcised with a
      circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the
      circumcision of <span class="hi">Christ</span>,</p>

      <p><sup>12</sup> having been buried with <span class="hi">him</span> in baptism, in
      which you were also raised with <span class="hi">him</span> through faith in the
      powerful working of God, who raised <span class="hi">him</span> from the dead.</p>

      <p><sup>13</sup> And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of
      your flesh, God made alive together with <span class="hi">him</span>, having
      forgiven us all our trespasses, </p>

      <p><sup>14</sup> by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its
      legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. </p>

      <p><sup>15</sup> He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame,
      by triumphing over them in <span class="hi">him</span>.</p>

      <p><sup>16</sup> Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and
      drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.</p>

      <p><sup>17</sup> These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs
      to <span class="hi">Christ</span>.</p>

      <p><sup>18</sup> Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of
      angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous
      mind,</p>

      <p><sup>19</sup> and not holding fast to the <span class="hi">Head</span>, from whom
      the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows
      with a growth that is from God.</p>

      <p><sup>20</sup> If with <span class="hi">Christ</span> you died to the elemental
      spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to
      regulations-</p>

      <p><sup>21</sup> "Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch" </p>

      <p><sup>22</sup> (referring to things that all perish as they are used)-according to
      human precepts and teachings? </p>

      <p><sup>23</sup> These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made
      religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in
      stopping the indulgence of the flesh.</p>

    <article>
      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

   <p><sup>1</sup> If then you have been raised with <span class="hi">Christ</span>, seek the things that
     are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</p>

   <p><sup>2</sup> Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are
     on earth.

   <p><sup>3</sup> For you have died, and your life is hidden with <span class="hi">Christ in God</span>.

   <p><sup>4</sup> When <span class="hi">Christ</span> who is your life appears, then you also will appear
     with him in glory.

   <p><sup>5</sup> Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual
     immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness,
     which is idolatry.

   <p><sup>6</sup> On account of these the wrath of God is coming.

   <p><sup>7</sup> In these you too once walked, when you were living in them.
   
   <p><sup>8</sup> But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice,
     slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.

   <p><sup>9</sup> Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old
     self with its practices

   <p><sup>10</sup> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in
     knowledge after the image of its creator.

   <p><sup>11</sup> Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and
     uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but <span class="hi">Christ</span> is
     all, and in all.

   <p><sup>12</sup> Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved,
     compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience,

   <p><sup>13</sup> bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against
     another, forgiving each other; as the <span class="hi">Lord</span> has forgiven you, so
     you also must forgive.

   <p><sup>14</sup> And above all these put on love, which binds everything
     together in perfect harmony.

   <p><sup>15</sup> And let the peace of <span class="hi">Christ</span> rule in your hearts, to which
     indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful.

   <p><sup>16</sup> Let the word of <span class="hi">Christ</span> dwell in you richly, teaching and
     admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns
     and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 

   <p><sup>17</sup> And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the
     name of the <span class="hi">Lord Jesus</span>, giving thanks to God the Father through
     him.

   <p><sup>18</sup> Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the <span class="hi">Lord</span>.

   <p><sup>19</sup> Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.

   <p><sup>20</sup> Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases
     the <span class="hi">Lord</span>.

   <p><sup>21</sup> Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become
     discouraged.

  <p><sup>22</sup> Bondservants, obey in everything those who are your earthly
     masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with
     sincerity of heart, fearing the <span class="hi">Lord</span>.

   <p><sup>23</sup> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the <span class="hi">Lord</span> and not for
     men,

   <p><sup>24</sup> knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as
     your reward. You are serving the <span class="hi">Lord Christ</span>.

   <p><sup>25</sup> For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done,
     and there is no partiality.

    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
   <p><sup>1</sup> Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing
     that you also have a <span class="hi">Master in heaven</span>.

   <p><sup>2</sup> Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with
     thanksgiving.

   <p><sup>3</sup> At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a
     door for the word, to declare the mystery of <span class="hi">Christ</span>, on account
     of which I am in prison-

   <p><sup>4</sup> that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.

   <p><sup>5</sup> Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the
     time.

   <p><sup>6</sup> Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that
     you may know how you ought to answer each person.

   <p><sup>7</sup> Tychicus will tell you all about my activities. He is a beloved
     brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the <span class="hi">Lord</span>.

   <p><sup>8</sup> I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know
     how we are and that he may encourage your hearts,

   <p><sup>9</sup> and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is
     one of you. They will tell you of everything that has taken place
     here.

   <p><sup>10</sup> Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin
     of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions-if he
     comes to you, welcome him),

   <p><sup>11</sup> and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the
     circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and
     they have been a comfort to me.

   <p><sup>12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of <span class="hi">Christ Jesus</span>, greets
     you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you
     may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.

   <p><sup>13</sup> For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for
     those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.

   <p><sup>14</sup> Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does Demas.

   <p><sup>15</sup> Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha
     and the church in her house.

   <p><sup>16</sup> And when this letter has been read among you, have it also
     read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read
     the letter from Laodicea.

   <p><sup>17</sup> And say to Archippus, "See that you fulfill the ministry that
     you have received in the <span class="hi">Lord</span>."

   <p><sup>18</sup> I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my
     chains. Grace be with you.
