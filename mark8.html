    <h1>The challenge of losing your life</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p><sup>35</sup> For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the
            gospel&#39;s will save it. <sup>36</sup> For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit
            his soul? <sup>37</sup> For what can a man give in return for his soul?</p>
        <p>Mark 8:35-37 ESV</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This passage and the parallel passages in Matthew 16 and Luke 9 are some of the most amazing words recorded in
        the Gospels. I vividly remember the first time that I heard a teaching on this passage over 20 years ago. I
        could not get it out of my head. I could not believe that Jesus was making such an ambitious call of what it
        means to follow Him. There is no part of my life that He is not asking for, and I was not entirely sure that was
        acceptable. I do not remember exactly how I resolved the tension at that time. I do know that interacting with
        God about the passage was an imporatant part of processing it. I also know that I had a different relationship
        with God after that, and I am thankful for it. After reading this again, I want to briefly examine three
        questions about the passage.</p>
    <h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-lose-your-life-">What does it mean to lose your life?</h2>
    <p>This has to be the core question we address when examining this passage. I think the answer is that we must be
        wholly devoted to God. We are no longer our own, we were bought with a price (1 Cor 6:20) and we must act
        consistent with this reality. Jesus wants us to examine our lives and come to Him. Just before this passage He
        is speaking to the disciples about His death and resurrection. He was here to save humanity, so the first way to
        lose your life is to believe what Jesus says about His. Jesus claims that we can know God and have eternal life
        with Him multiple times throughout the accounts of His life. All that is necessary is that we open the door for
        him to come into our lives (Rev
        3:20). That choice will begin the process of changing my life from one of trying to save it, to one of trying to
        lose it.</p>
    <h2 id="how-does-this-impact-my-daily-life-">How does this impact my daily life?</h2>
    <p>I can accept that Jesus is the owner of my time, but that does not mean that it works out well in my daily life.
        This is the second part of the challenge of this passage. It is not enough that I can say that Jesus death on
        the cross has transformed my future. I must be able to say that every action I take, every choice that I make,
        and all the thoughts in my head are submitted to Christ. There must be a radical change in the focus of our
        lives if we are to meet the challenge laid out in verse 35. Jesus addresses this in verses 36 and 37. We are
        either going to [try to] gain the whole world, or we are going to gain God by losing the world. I can either
        follow what I think is right, or I can follow what God says is right. This is one of the places in my life where
        I have seen
        the largest gap between knowing and doing. I will often know what it looks like to lose my life. I have a
        difficult time making the choice to do the right thing. </p>
    <h2 id="what-happens-if-i-ignore-this-">What happens if I ignore this?</h2>
    <p>Jesus tells us right after what I have quoted in Mark:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><sup>38</sup> For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him
            will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This sounds extreme. I was just writing about how choosing to follow Jesus will change my eternity, and here
        Jesus is saying that He will be ashamed of me if I do not &quot;lose my life&quot;. I do not believe that we
        need to be worried about eternity. There are plenty of places in God&#39;s word that we can see our eternal
        security is bought by Christ&#39;s death. What we miss out on instead is the great rewards that come from
        chosing to give my life to God, rather than following my own path. He has laid out plans for me (Jer 29:10), and
        will not forsake me (Joshua 1:5). A simple illustration that I see play out in my own home is when that I am
        often happier when I have been spending time relating with my family, than I am when I pursue my own interests.
        When I keep relying on Jesus' death on the cross to be my guidance in all situations, then I see changes in how
        I make choices.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conclusions-">Conclusions?</h2>
    <p>The best conclusion I have is that it is worth being challenged by God&#39;s word, and approaching Him with what
        you find there. He will meet you and help you see more of who He is. That is what happened to me with this
        passage, and my life is better for it.</p>
